### List every instance of {{ ENTITY }} 


The `customer.{{ RESOURCE_URL_NAME }}.list()` returns all of the entities in the account, including `REMOVED` entities. It also returns all other resources that can be selected with each instance of {{ ENTITY }}.

This method was designed for convenience and discovery. Internally, it uses the `customer.report()` method with all `attributes` fields included. For production code, we recommend using `customer.report()` with only the fields you need.

#### Arguments

- **`options`** (_optional_): Object of the form `{ limit, order_by, constraints }`:
    - **`limit`** (_optional, number_): Number of rows to return. Equivalent to the limit in `customer.report()`. Defaults to no limit.
    - **`order_by`** (_optional, string_): The field to sort the returned rows by. Equivalent to the order_by in `customer.report()`. By default, no sorting is applied.
    - **`constraints`** (_optional, array/object_): A constraints array or object. See the `customer.report()` documentation for details. By default, all entities are returned.

#### Returns

Returns an array of objects.
Each object has a `{{ENTITY_SNAKECASE}}` property. Any other resources that can be selected with `{{ENTITY_SNAKECASE}}` will also be added as properities.



``` javascript

// Listing all the {{ RESOURCE_URL_NAME }} in the account
let result = await customer.{{ RESOURCE_URL_NAME }}.list()

// Listing with constraints, sorting, and a limited number of results
let result = await customer.{{ RESOURCE_URL_NAME }}.list({
    constraints: [{
        key : '{{ENTITY_SNAKECASE}}.some_field',
        op : '=',
        val : 'yellow submarine'
    }],
    limit: 15,
    order_by : '{{ENTITY_SNAKECASE}}.some_field.sub_field'
})

```

``` javascript

// Example result
[{{ EXAMPLE_OBJECT_LIST }}]

```
