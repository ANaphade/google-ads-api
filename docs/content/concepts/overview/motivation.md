### Why does this library exist?

The official Google Ads client libraries are robust, but they don't always offer the most user-friendly developer interfaces, and their documentation can be confusing. 

This library aims to offer a better way to use the Google Ads API. [Opteo](https://opteo.com) uses it internally.

-   [`google-ads-node`](https://github.com/Opteo/google-ads-node) is a low-level Node implementation of the API which imitates the stucture of the other client libraries.
-   `google-ads-api` (this library) is a wrapper around `google-ads-node` to provide a better developer experience.
