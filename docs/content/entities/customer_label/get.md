### Get CustomerLabel

The `customer.customerLabels.get()` method returns all fields for one CustomerLabel, as well as all other entities related to it. Note that this function is heavily rate-limited by Google, so avoid using it in production.

```javascript
// Getting the entity
let result = await customer.customerLabels.get('customers/1234567890/customerLabels/123123123')
```

```javascript

// Example result
(// Todo: add example get() return here)

```
